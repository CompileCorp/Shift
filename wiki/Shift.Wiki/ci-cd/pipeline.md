# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the current CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline for the Shift project and describes its implementation, capabilities, and current state.

The Shift project is a .NET 9 library that provides database migration and Entity Framework code generation capabilities. Our CI/CD strategy focuses on automated testing, quality assurance, and streamlined package publishing.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Workflow Overview

We currently have two GitHub Actions workflows that handle different aspects of our CI/CD pipeline:

1. **PR Build and Test** (`pr-build-test.yml`) - Validates code quality on pull requests
2. **Build and Publish** (`build-and-publish.yml`) - Handles NuGet package publishing

### 1. PR Build and Test Workflow

**Purpose**: Ensures all code changes are validated before merging into the main branch.

**Triggers**:
- Pull requests targeting the main branch
- No direct pushes to main (protected branch)

**Process Flow**:
```
Pull Request Created/Updated
    ↓
Checkout Code
    ↓
Setup .NET 9.0.x
    ↓
Restore Dependencies
    ↓
Build Solution (Release)
    ↓
Run All Tests (with TRX output)
    ↓
Publish Test Results to GitHub UI
    ↓
✅ Pass / ❌ Fail
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Automated build validation
- ✅ Comprehensive test execution (all test projects)
- ✅ Visual test results in GitHub PR interface
- ✅ Clear failure reporting with detailed test results
- ✅ Protected main branch integration
- ✅ Professional test reporting using dorny/test-reporter@v2

### 2. Build and Publish Workflow

**Purpose**: Automatically publishes NuGet packages when version tags are created.

**Triggers**:
- Version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v2.1.3`)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Process Flow**:
```
Version Tag Created
    ↓
Extract Version from Tag
    ↓
Restore Dependencies
    ↓
Build Solution (Release)
    ↓
Run Tests (Shift.Tests only)
    ↓
Pack NuGet Package
    ↓
Publish to NuGet.org
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Automated version extraction from git tags
- ✅ Secure API key management
- ✅ NuGet.org publishing
- ✅ Manual trigger capability

## Industry Best Practices Comparison

### ✅ What We're Doing Well

| Practice | Status | Implementation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Pull Request Validation** | ✅ Implemented | All PRs must pass build and tests |
| **Automated Testing** | ✅ Implemented | Comprehensive test suite execution |
| **Test Result Reporting** | ✅ Implemented | Visual test results in GitHub PR interface |
| **Protected Main Branch** | ✅ Implemented | No direct pushes, PR-only workflow |
| **Automated Publishing** | ✅ Implemented | Tag-based NuGet publishing |
| **Version Management** | ✅ Implemented | Semantic versioning with git tags |
| **Secure Secrets** | ✅ Implemented | GitHub secrets for API keys |

### Current Gaps

| Practice | Status | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Security Scanning** | Not implemented | Medium risk |
| **Code Quality Checks** | Not implemented | Medium risk |
| **Multi-Platform Testing** | Ubuntu only | Low risk |
| **Test Coverage Reporting** | Not implemented | Low risk |
| **Performance Testing** | Not implemented | Low risk |
| **Documentation Generation** | Not implemented | Low risk |
| **Notification System** | Not implemented | Low risk |
| **Artifact Management** | Basic implementation | Low risk |

## Strengths

### 1. Protected Branch Strategy
- **Benefit**: Prevents direct commits to main branch
- **Impact**: Ensures all changes go through PR validation
- **Industry Alignment**: ✅ Best practice

### 2. Comprehensive Test Coverage with Visual Reporting
- **Benefit**: All test projects run on every PR with visual results in GitHub UI
- **Impact**: High confidence in code quality with clear visibility into test outcomes
- **Industry Alignment**: ✅ Best practice

### 3. Automated Publishing
- **Benefit**: Streamlined release process
- **Impact**: Reduces manual errors and deployment time
- **Industry Alignment**: ✅ Best practice

### 4. Version Management
- **Benefit**: Clear versioning with git tags
- **Impact**: Predictable releases and rollback capability
- **Industry Alignment**: ✅ Best practice

## Current Limitations

### Missing Features
- **Security Scanning**: No automated security vulnerability detection
- **Code Quality Checks**: No automated code analysis or linting
- **Multi-Platform Testing**: Currently only tests on Ubuntu
- **Test Coverage Reporting**: No visibility into coverage trends
- **Performance Testing**: No performance benchmarks
- **Documentation Generation**: No automated API documentation

### Impact Assessment
- **Security Risk**: Medium - No automated vulnerability detection
- **Code Quality Risk**: Medium - No automated code analysis
- **Platform Risk**: Low - Single platform testing may miss platform-specific issues
- **Maintenance Risk**: Low - Manual processes require more oversight

> **Note**: For planned improvements and enhancements, see the [CI/CD Development Backlog](../development/backlog-ci-cd.md).

## Conclusion

Our CI/CD pipeline provides a solid foundation with core best practices implemented. The protected branch strategy, comprehensive testing, and automated publishing create a reliable development workflow.

The current pipeline successfully:
- Validates all code changes through PR requirements
- Executes comprehensive test suites on every change
- Provides visual test results in GitHub PR interface
- Automatically publishes NuGet packages on version tags
- Maintains secure API key management

While there are opportunities for enhancement (as documented in the [CI/CD Development Backlog](../development/backlog-ci-cd.md)), the current pipeline effectively supports our development process and ensures code quality.
